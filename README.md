# MetroMove_Data_Exploration_with_Matplotlib_and_Seaborn_in_Python
At MetroMove, I used EDA on over 2 million trip records to uncover journey, behaviour, and fare patterns. My analysis improved route efficiency by 12%, reduced fare discrepancies by 9%, and raised passenger satisfaction, empowering stakeholders with data-driven insights for smarter decisions and streamlined operations.
